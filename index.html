<h1>netDx</h1>

netDx is a <b>patient classifier</b> algorithm that can integrate several types of patient data into a single model. It does this by converting each type of data into a view of patient similarity; i.e. by converting the data into a graph in which more similar patients are tightly linked, while less similar patients are not so tightly linked.
